We will now perform cross-validation on a simulated data set.

## (a)

Generate a simulated data set as follows:

```{r}
set.seed (1)
y=rnorm (100)
x=rnorm (100)
y=x-2* x^2+ rnorm (100)
```

In this data set, what is n and what is p? Write out the model
used to generate the data in equation form.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```
